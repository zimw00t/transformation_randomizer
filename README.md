# transformation_randomizer
This is a simple tool for use in online ERP. If you're seeing this repository at all it's probably because I gave you the link directly, so I won't bother putting any specific content warnings. You know what I'm about.

Download the latest version of renpy if you don't already have it, clone the repository and put 'main' file wherever you want. You can also rename it to whatever if you want, doesn't matter. If python is installed correctly it should automatically run using pythonw.exe, if not set that as the default program manually or you can use the command line like some kind of linux nerd.
